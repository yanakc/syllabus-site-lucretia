Scroll along to find out who was Lucretia, what are the key elements of the painting and why is it deemed unconventional.


Strong-looking women are not to be found in most Renaissance paintings. Why is she staring at us like that? What is she pointing at? At first glance, it is a portrait of a wealthy woman. However, a closer look reveals an image that challenges the traditional stereotypes of women as objects of the male gaze.

## But first … Who was the Roman heroine Lucretia? 

To understand Lotto’s painting, we must first know the story of the **Roman heroine Lucretia**. The legend of Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus,  was used in the Roman Republic to symbolize proper womanly virtues such as beauty and chastity and her story was an inspiration for many writers and artists in later times.

The story begins with a drinking bet between young men at Sextus Tarquinius' home, the son of the king of Rome. They decide to surprise their wives to see how they behave in their absence. Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, behaves virtuously, unlike the other wives of the king's sons. Several days later, Sextus Tarquinius goes to Collatinus' home and is given hospitality. When everyone else is asleep in the house, he goes to Lucretia's bedroom and threatens her with a sword, demanding that she submit to his advances. When she shows no fear of death, he threatens to kill her and stage her body with a servant's to imply adultery. rewrite: She submits, but in the morning calls her father, husband, and uncle and she tells them how she has "lost her honor" and demands that they avenge her rape. Though the men try to convince her that she bears no dishonor, she disagrees and kills herself, her "punishment" for losing her honor.

## Lorenzo Lotto

Lorenzo Lotto (about 1480 - 1556) was an important Italian painter of the High Renaissance and early Mannerism. He painted almost exclusively religious subjects, portraits, and a few allegorical pictures. Lotto worked mainly in Northern Italy and is traditionally included in the Venetian School. His art follows the naturalistic ideals of the High Renaissance, but he often disrupts their typical harmony with unusually dynamic poses and distortions.

## What

A *Syllabus Site* is a one-page website arranging its elements along sections that can be scrolled vertically. [^1]

[^1]: test


### Design

The webpage is designed with the aim to open an evocative information space, where the sources that foster creativity, dialogue, and learning can be gathered, recapitulated, and appreciated. The monolithic structure of conventional documents is broken up, by introducing a relational quality to the connections between sections and items.


### Structure

There are two main types of elements:

- **Sections** – Larger blocks gather the material for weekly course sessions.
- **Items** – Smaller elements feature images, text, and other content.

Each item is connected with its section by a thin line. The navigation (≡) gives access to all sections.

The last section acts as the footer, where the typical array of logos and links belongs.


### Examples

The template is in use to document the following [Interface Design](https://interface.fh-potsdam.de) courses offered at [FH Potsdam](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/):

- **[Decolonizing Data Visualization – Visualizing Postcolonies](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/decolonizing/)** (Summer 2022)
- **[Organigrams for/from the future](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/organigrams/)** (Summer 2023)

## How

The *Syllabus Site* template can be easily used with minimal technical requirements.


![](img/sidebyside.webp)  
Page content and source side by side


### Get started

1. Download or clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/syllabus-site/)
2. Give your page a title, fill out open graph fields, and adjust theme color in `index.html`
3. Add your content into `README.md` and `img/`


### Files

The template has the following file structure:

      img/
      index.html
      src/
      README.md

The `README.md` file contains all the textual content of your page and references the images that you need to add to the `img/` directory. 

The `index.html` file connects template and your content; here you need to make a few edits to add title, description, and preview of your webpage. 

You do not need to change anything within `src/`, which contains the internal files of the template.


### Syntax

The `README.md` uses the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format, a markup language used by many platforms including GitHub.

There are two conventions we introduce to distinguish and connect sections and items:

- **Sections** are delineated by a horizontal rule `---` 
- **Items** are separated by two empty consecutive lines

Each section should contain a heading:
`#` for primary, `##` for secondary, and so on.

To exclude a section from the navigation menu, include `<!--skipnav-->` at the start of the section.



### Things to consider

- Include an expressive preview image `img/cover.png` so that your page can be previewed on social media and messaging apps.
- Given that your webpage might be accessed from a mobile device with a slow connection make sure to optimize image file sizes.
